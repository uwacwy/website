				<h2>A Letter from our 2012 Campaign Chairs</h2>

<h3>WE NEED YOUR HELP, PLEASE!</h3>
<p>Now that I hopefully have your attention, I will attempt to explain why even a small contribution of at least $1 a pay period will make a difference to people in need here in Albany County.</p>
<p>I will start with some recent bad news that you might have seen or heard.  Everyone knows that for the past few years we all have been dealing with the repercussions of a sluggish economy.  Even as the private sector seems to have recovered from 2008-2009, government on all levels continue to cut programs that help people in need of a variety of services.  The biggest cut was also the latest one â€“ the sequester.  This has had a direct effect on some of our agencies and an indirect effect on the rest.  One of our member agencies was cut by $36,000 because of the sequester.  Another agency is facing a $100,000+ figure shortfall because of the sequester and a change in the way the state reimburses agencies for services.  I could go on and on.</p>
<h3>Now, the good news.</h3>
<p>For 55 years the United Way of Albany County has been here working to make our community a better place for all of us.</p>
<p>What this means now is this.  For 2013, the United Way will be supporting 14 essential human service agencies right here in Albany County. Your contributions are added to those of over a thousand other people, and collectively, they have an amazing impact on our community. These agencies are the same as last year, and cover the gamut of social services here in Albany County.  (A complete list with brief agency descriptions is in the enclosed brochure).  These agencies assist people from childhood through the golden years, and help people in all demographic categories in our county.  I can assure you these agencies will at some point this year, help either one of your fellow employees, friends, neighbors, business clients, or even a member of your own family.</p>
<p>This year, we have increased our campaign by 5%, to $420,000.  That is a big jump, especially when many in our community have not gotten a raise where they work.  On the other hand, we know that all the agencies supported by the United Way are also facing funding cuts from governmental and private sources, and they need the support of the community more than ever.  We also know how generous the people of Laramie can be when called upon, and that is exactly what we are doing.  We are calling upon you to help us reach our goal.  This is where your payroll deduction contribution comes in.  For just a dollar or two a pay period we can feed a family, provide counseling for a battered woman, find temporary shelter for a homeless person, and much, much, more.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your support.  Any and all contributions would be greatly appreciated and are tax deductible. If you have any questions about this letter or the United Way please feel free to contact Paul Heimer (307) 745-8643, who is Executive Director of the United Way.</p>

				<p>Thanks for your support!<br>
