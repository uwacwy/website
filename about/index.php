				<p>United Way of Albany County is a volunteer-based non-profit organization that raises and distributes funds to 14 participating agencies in the Laramie area.</p>
				<p>When United Way of Albany County was established, it was a vision of the future - a future dedicated to improving the quality of life for all. United Way volunteers have been building on that vision for six decades.</p>
				<p>Today, the many changes taking place in our community have created heightened social problems. United Way is positioned to respond to these problems. Through community-wide human service planning and direct support of agencies, United Way is answering the expanded needs for children, poor, elderly, disadvantaged, abused, disabled and discouraged.</p>
				<p>It is our goal to help the people of Albany County achieve satisfactory fulfillment and to increase the organized capacity of people to care for one another. </p>
				<p>Volunteer your time today, or donate to our 2013 campaign and help us to accomplish our goal of $415,000 this year!</p>
