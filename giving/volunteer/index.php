			<p>With only one full time Director and one part-time paid staff we would not be able to accomplish all that is needed to make UWAC a successful non-profit. We brought in over $375,000 this year because of our generous donors and all of our volunteers!</p>
			<p>Our governing board consists of 20 volunteers who work year round and during our campaign (Sept. 15th – Nov. 15th) we enlist the help of over 275 volunteers. We finish off with a group of about 40 who help with our allocation process (April/May) and other needs throughout the year.</p>
			<p>If you are interested in finding out more about volunteering your time for this worthy cause, please contact our office today!</p>
